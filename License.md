The R scripts were written by Robert W Burn and Fiona M Underwood. Most of the code was originally written under the Darwin Initiative project 17-020 implemented by the University of Reading with TRAFFIC International as the beneficiary. This code has since been extended and adapted whilst the authors were working under contract to TRAFFIC International. Some code has been written independently of this by the authors.

As such, copyright of the R scripts is shared between University of Reading/TRAFFIC International/RW Burn & FM Underwood.
